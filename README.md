## **Highway Planning** 
Score: *71.30*  
Rank: *1*  
Algorithmic solution: *Kruskal's algorithm* adapted to find both the
MST and the 2nd best MST.

## **Paddy Field**
Score: *88.80*  
Rank: *1*  
Algorithmic solution: *Greedy solution* by transforming 
each scarecrow's circular region into a line and 
ordering all lines by their beginning.  

## **Router Attack**
Score: *78.00*  
Rank: *1*  
Algorithmic solution: *Fordâ€“Fulkerson algorithm* with a modified input 
graph to allow nodes to be removed instead of just the edges.

## **Saving Money and Fuel**
Score: *71.40*  
Rank: *1*  
Algorithmic solution: *Dijkstra's algorithm* with a modified input graph
